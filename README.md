# Northcoders News API

How to create the environment variables for anyone who wishes to clone my project and run it locally.
1. You will need to create two .env files for my project: .env.test and .env.development
2. Into each, add PGDATABASE= : For the test env add nc_news_test it should look like this PGDATABASE=nc_news_test and for the dev env add nc_news it should look like this PGDATABASE=nc_news

NOTE:
Please do not add a semi-colon at the end of the PGDATABASE= lines as this will cause it to not work
